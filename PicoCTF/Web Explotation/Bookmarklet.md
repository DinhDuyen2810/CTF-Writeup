# Description 

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Browse `here`, and find the flag!

# Hints

A bookmarklet is a bookmark that runs JavaScript instead of loading a webpage.

What happens when you click a bookmarklet?

Web browsers have other ways to run JavaScript too.

# Solution 

You can see a `JavaScript` code snippet. When you click on it, the code automatically copies to your clipboard.

Since you can execute this JavaScript code on the website, open `DevTools`, navigate to the `Console` tab, paste the copied code, and press `Enter`. The flag will then be displayed.


The flag is: `picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_0c******}`
