# Description 

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Browse `here`, and find the flag!

# Hints

Try CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.

Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.

What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

# Solution 

Press the  `Ctrl + U` to view the page source. 

The source code appears all in one line. Enable auto line break for better readability.

Look carefully, and you’ll find the flag.

The flag is: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_51******}`
