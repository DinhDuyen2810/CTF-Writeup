# Description 

Can you get the flag?
Go to this `website` and see what you can discover.

# Hints

Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

# Solution 

Open the source code using Ctrl + U to view the HTML source.

Then, look for other URLs, such as:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

`<script src="script.js"></script>`

Or open DevTools and go to the `Sources` tab.

Click on both of them to find two flag paths.


The flag is: `picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df******}`
